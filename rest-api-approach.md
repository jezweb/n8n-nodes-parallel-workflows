Yes, that is an excellent and perfectly viable solution. You've hit on the **de facto standard method** for how a custom node should perform actions that are normally handled by the n8n core engine.

This "REST API Fallback" is not so much a fallback as it is the **recommended and most robust implementation strategy** for a custom node that needs to trigger other workflows.

Let's break down exactly why this approach is so effective and how it would be implemented.

### Why This Approach is a Great Idea

*   **It uses the Official API:** You are interacting with n8n through a stable, documented, and officially supported interface (the REST API). This means your node is far less likely to break with future n8n updates compared to trying to hook into internal, undocumented functions.
*   **It's Secure:** By creating a dedicated credential type for the n8n API key, you leverage n8n's built-in security features. The key is encrypted at rest and managed properly, rather than being stored as a plain string in the node's parameters.
*   **It's Architecturally Clean:** It maintains a clear separation of concerns. Your custom node is an "API client," and the n8n instance is the "server." This is a standard, easy-to-understand pattern.
*   **It's Asynchronous by Nature:** When you call the n8n API endpoint to start a workflow, the API responds almost instantly with a confirmation that the execution has started. It does *not* wait for the workflow to finish. This is the exact "fire-and-forget" behavior required to launch multiple workflows in parallel.

### Detailed Implementation Plan

Here is a more detailed look at the steps you outlined:

#### 1. Create a Custom Credential Type

First, you would define a new credential for n8n. In the `credentials` folder of your custom node package, you would create a file like `N8nApi.credentials.ts`.

```typescript
// N8nApi.credentials.ts
export class N8nApi implements ICredentialType {
    name = 'n8nApi';
    displayName = 'n8n API';
    properties: INodeProperties[] = [
        {
            displayName: 'API Key',
            name: 'apiKey',
            type: 'string',
            typeOptions: { password: true }, // Obscures the key in the UI
            default: '',
        },
        {
            displayName: 'n8n Instance URL',
            name: 'baseUrl',
            type: 'string',
            default: '',
            placeholder: 'https://n8n.example.com',
            description: 'The base URL of your n8n instance',
        }
    ];
}
```

#### 2. Implement the Node Logic

In your node's `execute` method, you would perform the following steps:

```typescript
// Inside your node's execute method
// (Simplified pseudo-code)

async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    // 1. Get credentials for the n8n API
    const credentials = await this.getCredentials('n8nApi') as { apiKey: string; baseUrl: string; };
    
    // 2. Get the list of workflows to execute from the node's parameters
    const workflowsToRun = this.getNodeParameter('workflowsToRun', 0, []) as any[];

    // 3. Loop and trigger each workflow via REST API
    for (const workflow of workflowsToRun) {
        const workflowId = workflow.workflowId;
        const body = { /* optional input data for the sub-workflow */ };

        const options: OptionsWithUri = {
            headers: {
                'X-N8N-API-KEY': credentials.apiKey,
            },
            method: 'POST',
            body,
            uri: `${credentials.baseUrl}/api/v1/workflows/${workflowId}/executions`, // The API endpoint
            json: true,
        };

        // 4. Make the non-blocking HTTP request
        // We don't use 'await' here if we want to fire them all in parallel
        // or we can use Promise.all() for better control.
        this.helpers.httpRequest(options);
    }
    
    // ... then proceed with the logic to wait for the webhooks to be called back
    
    return this.prepareOutputData([]);
}
```

#### 3. Handle Authentication and Errors

*   **Authentication:** The `X-N8N-API-KEY` header in the `httpRequest` handles the authentication, as shown above.
*   **Error Handling:** You should wrap the `this.helpers.httpRequest` call in a `try...catch` block. If the API call fails (e.g., due to a wrong URL, invalid API key, or non-existent workflow), you can catch the error and either fail the node with a clear message or log the error and continue.

### Conclusion

You are on exactly the right track. Using the n8n REST API from within your custom node is the correct, professional, and most maintainable way to achieve your goal of triggering other workflows. It provides a stable and secure foundation upon which you can build the rest of your node's logic (like managing the webhook callbacks and aggregating results).
